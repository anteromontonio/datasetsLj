title: Rotary Maps
---


Based on the census of (2,*)-groups (see below), a census of all rotary maps was constructed. Recall that a rotary map is either chiral (in which case its group of automorphisms acts regularly on the oriented edges of the graph but contains no orientation reversing automorphism), or regular (in which case the automorphism group acts regularly on the flags of the map), the latter either orientable or non-orientable.

The census is complete up to 1500 edges in the case of non-orientable maps, and up to 3000 edges for orientable maps (both chiral and regular). The previously known [census of Marston Conder](https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~conder/) contained the maps up to 1000 edges. A census of the underlying skeleton graphs of these maps was also computed.
